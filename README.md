## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This is a **beginner-friendly SQL project** that simulates a **Library Management System** using MySQL.  
It allows you to manage books, library members, and track borrowed books.  
The project demonstrates **table creation, relationships, CRUD operations, and views**.

## ðŸ›  Features
- Add, update, and delete books
- Register new library members
- Borrow and return books with automatic stock updates
- View all borrowed books with member details

   - `book_id`, `title`, `author`, `genre`, `available_copies`

## ðŸ’» SQL Operations Demonstrated
- **DDL**: `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP DATABASE`, constraints
- **DML**: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- **JOINS**: Combining data from multiple tables
- **VIEWS**: `CREATE VIEW` for borrowed books report
- **CHECK Constraints**: Ensuring available copies are non-negative

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Open **MySQL Command Line** or a GUI like **phpMyAdmin** / **MySQL Workbench**.
2. Copy the entire SQL script from `library_management.sql`.
3. Paste and execute the script.
4. Run queries like:
